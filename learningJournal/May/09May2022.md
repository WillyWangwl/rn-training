## What I Am Doing

<oL>
  <li>    
    Learning for React Native.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Custom Hook</b> <br />
            Making hook reusable.
             <ol>
                <li>Custom Hooks are functions. Usually, they start with the word “use” (important convention).</li>
                <li>We can decide what it takes as arguments, and what, if anything, it should return. In other words, it’s just like a normal function</li>
                <li>When you have component logic that needs to be used by multiple components, we can extract that logic to a custom Hook.</li>
                <li>advantages to using Custom Hooks
                    <ul>
                        <li>Reusability — we can use the same hook again and again, without the need to write it twice</li>
                        <li>Clean Code — extracting all the component logic into a hook will provide a cleaner codebase.</li>
                        <li>Maintainability — easier to maintain. if we need to change the logic of the hook, we only need to change it once.</li>
                        <li>Great Community — there is a good chance somebody already created the hook you're thinking of. The web is filled with a ton of Custom Hooks! you can find a hook for your need and use it as-is or even better — you can use it as a starting point and make it awesome!</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Study useLogin hook in the existing react-native-starter project
            <ol>
                <li></li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Add a custom hook to add network status monitor to the react-native-starter project.
            <ol>
                <li>Cant sport any different after i complete the code. It will show error message after i turn off the wifi and reload.</li>
                <li>Is just like how we calling useState.</li>
                <img src="../img/May/09/01.png" width="200"/><br />
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>return {isNetworkConnected: isNetworkConnected ?? false} <br />The double question mark operator is called the nullish coalescing operator, and it’s a new feature of JavaScript ES2020 that allows you provide a default value to use when a variable expression evaluates to null or undefined</li>
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Try to refactor my mini project. Break item to multiple component. And create custom hook</li>

</ol>
