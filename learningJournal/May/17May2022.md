## What I Am Doing

<oL>
  <li>    
    Learning for React Native.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Advanced State Management with Context</b> <br />
             <ol>
                <li>Create navigator as usual.</li>
                <li>To wire up blog Post Provide we need to wrap every component including stack navigator.</li>
                <li>Context<br />
                    - Move information from parent to nested child. It is not manage the state.<br />
                    - Complicated to setup, lot of special terms<br />
                    - Easy to communicate data from a parent to super nested child<br />
                </li>
                <li>create a new folder call context that keep the file of provider</li>
                <li>React createContext - Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree.</li>
                <li>{ children } - A component that wrapped inside other component and accept as an argument.<br />

                    so which means&#60;AppStack /&#62; is our children. 
                </li>
                <li>Context.Provider - Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes.</li>
                <li>value in Provider - to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider</li>
                <li>Add the state on the Provider, so any time state variable change it will pass down new value from Provider to different component that are connected with that provider.  </li>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Screen<br />
            <img src="../img/May/13/04.png" width="200"/>
            <img src="../img/May/13/05.png" width="200"/>
            <img src="../img/May/13/06.png" width="200"/>
