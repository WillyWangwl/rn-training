## What I Am Doing

<oL>
  <li>    
    Learning for React Native.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>React Native Restaurant App</b> <br />
            learn how to create an app from scratch and create the navigation and search bar
             <ol>
                <li>there are two things we can use to make a network request from react native app: fetch & axios</li>
                <li>fetch - build in function, error handling is a bit weird,  requires us to write a lot of wrapper code.</li>
                <li>axios - Separate library for making requests, east to use and sensible defaults,</li>
                <li>to install axios - npm install axios</li>
                <li>there are few way to the wait for response of the Api before we execute next code.</li>
                    - put async at the function. const searchApi = async () => { ... } <br />
                    - using .then after the Api. yelp.get( "/search" ).then ... <br />
                    - using await. const response = await yelp.get( "/search" );. <br />
                <li>We me tp pass in a couple of different parameter to customize the search</li>
                <li>first argument - /search -  it will concatenated onto our base URL back inside of our yelp.</li>
                <li>Second argument - object that include params</li>
                <li>params - any key value put in param will be automatically appended onto our request</li>
                <li>The try...catch statement specifies a block of code to try along with a response should an error occur. The try statement contains one or more try blocks, and ends with at least one catch.</li>

   <br />
3. Get the error same with Janson "Unrecognised font family Material Design icons" after npm i --save-dev @types/react-native-vector-icons. Follow the solution that Janson provide.
   - Find info.plist at ios/starter/ .
