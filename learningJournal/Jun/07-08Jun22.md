## What I Am Doing

  <li>    
    Learning for React Native.<br />
    <ul>
        <li>for 07/06 unable to solve the issue with unit test. For the header part, unable the get the icon not sure is on useEffect or others issue. Base on some reading we use getByText for the render item before useEffect. Follow some solution on stackOverFlow to use await waitFor to wait for the useEffect render. But still unable to get the icon on header.</li>
        <li>Try to mock on the axios and data but not able to pass the test for the dispatch and action ons server. No idea how to solve it. </li>
        <li>Progress remain the same. <br />
