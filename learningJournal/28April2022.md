## What I Am Doing

<oL>
  <li>    
    Learning for React Native.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>Handling Screen Layout</b> <br />
             <ol>
                <li>flex - will define how your items are going to “fill” over the available space along your main axis.</li>
                <li>flexDirection -  controls the direction in which the children of a node are laid out </li>
                <li>justifyContent - describes how to align children within the main axis of their container. </li>
                <li>alignItems - describes how to align children along the cross axis of their container.</li>
                <li>alignSelf - has the same options and effect as alignItems but instead of affecting the children within a container, you can apply this property to a single child to change its alignment within its parent..</li>
                <li>flexWrap - property is set on containers and it controls what happens when children overflow the size of the container along the main axis</li>
                <li>The position type of an element defines how it is positioned within its parent</li>
                <li>relative - By default, an element is positioned relatively. This means an element is positioned according to the normal flow of the layout, and then offset relative to that position based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left. The offset does not affect the position of any sibling or parent elements. </li>
                <li>absolute - when positioned absolutely, an element doesn't take part in the normal layout flow. It is instead laid out independent of its siblings. The position is determined based on the top, right, bottom, and left values</li>
            </ol>
