## Challenge
1. Learn to use mac keyboard that a bit different with window keyboard. 
2. Not familiar with Github, face the issue that unable to find my repo when I push to my repo, thanks to Alvin for helping me solve my issue. We re-create the folder and clone again, then we try to use $git remote rename origin upstream and $ git remote add origin [myRepo]. Everything work fine after that.
