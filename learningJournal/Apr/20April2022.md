## What I Am Doing

<oL>
  <li>    
    Learning for React Native.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>State</b> <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Callback functions in React
                    <ul>
                        <li>Information in React gets passed around to components in two different ways.</li>
                        <li>First, information can get passed from parent to child as props. That seems pretty straightforward</li>
                        <li>Establish the property when creating an instance of the child component and it will be available to that instance</li>
                        <li>Instead of passing down a piece of the state to a child component, the parent can pass down a callback function. </li>
                        <li>This callback function is run at a later time, usually through some interaction with the child component. </li>
                        <li>The purpose of this callback function is to change a piece of the state that is a part of the parent component. </li>
                        <li>This closes the data loop<br />

                    <ul>
                        <li>Three question
                            <ol>
                                <li>What piece of data inside this application is changing? <br />
                                    Color - Red , Green, Blue.
                                </li>
                                <li>What type of data is it? Is it a number, a string an object, or an array?< br />
                                number
                                </li>
                                <li>What is the starting value of piece of data?<br />
                                    0
                                </li>
                            </ol>
                        </li>
                        <li><img src="./img/20Apr1.jpg" width="500"/></li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <b>Challenge Question</b> <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Apply the same component to the react-native-starter project, Try to add the color label under the color square.
                    <ol>
                        <li>Try to add the color label under the color square<li>
                        <li>Convert the states of red, blue, green into a state of object with property of red, blue and green.<br />
                            <img src="./img/20Apr2.jpg" width="500"/><br />
                        </li>
                        <li>Try to initial state with null and fix the issue to make it work.<br />
                            <img src="./img/20Apr3.jpg" width="500"/><br />
                            Error message showed even I try to declare object to rgb, due to reading null object.<br/>
                            hardcode to do null checking and everything can display with warning.<br />
                            <img src="./img/20Apr4.jpg" width="500"/><br />
                        </li>
                        <li>Write a function to checking the value is more than 255 or less than 0<br />
                            <img src="./img/21Apr1.jpg" width="500"/><br />
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Challenge for myself
                    <ol>
                        <li>Try to pass different value from Child component and doing increase or decrease at the parent component.<br />
                            <img src="./img/21Apr2.jpg" width="500"/><br />
                            squareScreen onChangeColor accepted value that passed from it child component.<br />
                            child component TouchableOpacity onPress function will pass in a value( 1, -1, 10, -10) to parent function.
                            Parent function will take in the value and adding color base on the value that passed in. 
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    </li>

</ol>

<!-- Challenge -->

## Challenge

1. Take sometime to understand the null issue and how to solve it. Getting error after even I setRgb to the value at the beginning.<br />
   try to use console log to check the sequence of page render. Realize that page will render component first before set the value.<br />
   Try to remove the display rgb part and it works. So decide to add on the rgb null checking in the display part to avoid the error.<br />
   For this challenge I notice that is not a good way to set useState initial value to null. It will make a lot of error and warning.<br />
