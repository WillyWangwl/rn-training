## What I Am Doing

<oL>
  <li>    
    Learning for React Native.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <b>State</b> <br />
            <ul>
                <li>There are two types of data state and props in React Native which control the component.</li> 
                <li>The component that uses the state is mutable. They can be changed later on if required.</li>
                <li>The props component is immutable, and it is fixed throughout the lifetime.</li>
                <li>The state is generally initialized in constructor and then call setState when we want to change it.</li>
                <li>We never directly modify a state variable. React doesn't detect this change. Only use the "setter" function </li>
                <li>We can track any kind of data that changes over time - a number , string, array of object, etc.</li>
                <li>When a component is rerendered, all of its children get rerendered too.</li>
                <li>A state variable can be passed to a child component. At that point, the state variable is now being used as props.</li>
                <li><b>Why never change the state directly</b><br />
                    - You may just replace the update you made.<br />
                    - When you directly update the state, it does not change this.state immediately. Instead, it creates a pending state transition, and accessing it after calling this method will only return the present value. <br />
                    - You will lose control of the state across all components.<br />
                </li>
            </ul><br />

        <li>
            <b>Challenge Question</b> <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Try to use normal declaration for variable counter, and no error for that.</li>
                <li>Next try to change onPress function to normal adding function - counter++ <br />
                We change get any update on screen and console log.
                <li>replace by using state. And able to see update on the spot when we click on the increase or decrease.</li>
