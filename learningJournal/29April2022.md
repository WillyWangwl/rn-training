## What I Am Doing

<oL>
  <li>Learning for React Native.</li>
  <li>Challenge Question</li>
  <li>To Create a project
    <ul>
      <li>npx expo-cli init [project name] - to create a new project </li>
      <li>npm i @react-navigation/native - to install package for routing and navigation for your React Native apps.</li>
      <li>npm i @react-navigation/stack - Stack Navigator provides a way for your app to transition between screens where each new screen is placed on top of a stack</li>
      <li>gestureEnabled: false - to disable the swipe gesture for the screen</li>
      <li>headerLeft: () =>null - to remove the back button.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Splash Screen
    <ul>
      <li>Use Animated.timing to show item in delay and with fade in animation</li>
      <li>new Animated.Value(0) to initial the visible value to 0</li>
      <li>Animated.timing - animates a values overt time using easing function</li>
      <li>useEffect - to tell React that your component need to do something after render.</li>
      <li>useNavigation - is a hook which gives access to navigation object. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Information Screen
    <ul>
      <li>Using flatlist to display 3 pages in carousel mode. </li>
      <li>useRef - returns a mutable ref object whose .current property. The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component </li>
      <li>flatlist - bounces - disable the bouncing effect on the first or last page</li>
      <li>onMomentumScrollEnd - do something when you scroll to the end of current page.</li>
      <li></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Screen Display
      <img src="./img/29Apr/29Apr1.jpg" width="200"/>
      <img src="./img/29Apr/29Apr2.jpg" width="200"/><br />
      <img src="./img/29Apr/29Apr3.jpg" width="200"/>
      <img src="./img/29Apr/29Apr4.jpg" width="200"/><br />
      <img src="./img/29Apr/29Apr5.jpg" width="200"/>
      <img src="./img/29Apr/29Apr6.jpg" width="200"/><br />
  </li>
</ol>

## Challenge

1. Special thanks to CJ to help me solve my issue. My package dependencies conflict with the npm. Use npm audit fix --legacy-peer-deps to fix the issue.
   - The audit command submits a description of the dependencies configured in your project to your default registry and asks for a report of known vulnerabilities
2. Think to use a loop to display an Image 10 times with different position and show up times. Took some time to research how to do it. Normally found way to display a single image with animated. And found on stackoverflow that can use array to store the value of animated value and can each value in array when we call the animated timing.
3. After set up the animated, I found that 10 image show up together, and they way to show them 1 by 1 is to set different delay time for each image.
   So I use the index number \* time to set different time for each image.
4. Plan to use custom packages to do the carousel effect. But after a few read up, flatlist and scrollview can do that too. So decided to use flatlist to make carousel. But found that each page wont stop at it end point when scrolling, try to add in pagingEnable to make is to at each end point of the page.
5. I design to use button to switch between page. So need to use useRef and useEffect to make it. useRef use to scroll to the index page and together with useEffect. When click on the next button, will update the state and render the page, so useEffect will run the useRef to set the page to the next page when program render.
